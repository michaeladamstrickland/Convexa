Sprint 6.1 Status Acknowledgment & Next Steps

Thanks for the thorough update. Here's a formal response summarizing what's working, what’s pending, and the go-forward plan to fully close out Sprint 6.1 and prepare for Epic 7.

✅ What’s Working Great
🧠 CRM Activity Auto-Emission

enrichmentWorker.ts:

enrichment.completed events are now logged to crm_activities with detailed metadata: investmentScore, tags, condition, reasons, and tagReasons.

Webhook emission to subscribers is functional and metrics updated.

matchmakingWorker.ts:

matchmaking.completed CRM activity recorded with matchmakingJobId and matchedCount in metadata.

Webhooks fired, and success/fail metrics captured.

🧪 Endpoints, Metrics & Docs

POST /api/admin/crm-activity: Validations in place; optional webhook trigger.

GET /api/admin/crm-activity: Full filter support by type, leadId, propertyId, userId, createdAt, plus cursor pagination.

Metrics emitted:

leadflow_crm_activity_total{type="..."}

leadflow_crm_activity_webhook_total{status="success|fail"}

📚 Documentation:

CRM_ACTIVITY.md created and linked in README.md

CRM section added to ENDPOINTS.md

✅ Type Safety

Server-only tsconfig.server.json passes cleanly.

All backend changes typecheck without error.

🧪 Tests

crm-activity.test.ts: Validates POST and GET behavior.

webhook-crm-activity.test.ts: Verifies webhook delivery, header signing, and metrics exposure.

🚧 Known Issues
⚠️ Prisma Generate/Migrate on Windows

Local .prisma file rename conflict due to EPERM (likely antivirus or file lock).

✅ Mitigation: CI handles Prisma migration generation and schema diffing.

🔜 Next Steps
1. ✅ Finalize Sprint 6.1

 Add unit tests to assert automatic CRM activity creation from:

enrichmentWorker.ts

matchmakingWorker.ts

 Optionally seed a call.summary CRM activity in tests and assert:

leadflow_crm_activity_total{type="call.summary"}

 Mark SPRINT6_PLAN.md as fully complete once tests land.

 Re-confirm all activity-related metrics appear in /api/dev/metrics.

2. 🚀 Epic 7 Kickoff Prep

 Begin planning the AI Cold Calling & Conversation Intelligence infrastructure.

 Scope the following integration:

Twilio Programmable Voice – for call delivery & audio collection.

Whisper or AssemblyAI – for transcription.

OpenAI (GPT) – for scoring intent, summarizing key points, tagging.

 Target flow:

Trigger outbound call
  → Stream audio live or post-call
    → Transcribe to text
      → Analyze with GPT
        → Log CRM activity:
           type = "call.summary"
           metadata = { transcript, tags, score, summary }
          → Emit webhook to CRM subscriber


 Start feasibility testing for:

Latency on transcription APIs

Streaming call audio + post-call processing flow

Accuracy of GPT summary + scoring logic

✅ How to Validate Now
🔍 Test Metrics Exposure
curl -s http://localhost:3001/api/dev/metrics | grep leadflow_crm_activity

🧪 Manual CRM Activity POST
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/admin/crm-activity \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "type": "manual.note", "metadata": { "note": "Test entry" } }'

📄 Confirm Entry
curl -s http://localhost:3001/api/admin/crm-activity

📁 File Summary (Changed in Sprint 6.1)

enrichmentWorker.ts — emit CRM activity post-enrichment

matchmakingWorker.ts — emit CRM activity on matchmaking completion

schema.prisma — add CrmActivity model

adminMetrics.ts — add POST/GET endpoints

devQueueRoutes.ts — export CRM activity metrics

crm-activity.test.ts & webhook-crm-activity.test.ts — test coverage

README.md, CRM_ACTIVITY.md, ENDPOINTS.md — docs updated

Let me know when you're ready to push the next PR for those auto-emit tests and call.summary metric. Once that lands, we’ll close 6.1 and launch into Epic 7. 🔥 (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)
