# Scraping Implementation Guide Update

## New Features Implemented

We have significantly enhanced our scraping and data fusion infrastructure with the following new features:

### 1. Playwright-Based Scraping Infrastructure

We've implemented a sophisticated web scraping system using Playwright that includes:

- **Advanced Anti-Detection Features**: Prevents scraper blocking through browser fingerprint randomization
- **Human-Like Behavior Simulation**: Mouse movements, scrolling, and realistic typing patterns
- **Proxy Integration**: Support for rotating residential and datacenter proxies
- **Captcha Detection & Handling**: Identifies captcha challenges and provides screenshot capture
- **Configurable Stealth Mode**: Comprehensive browser fingerprint manipulation

Key files:
- `src/scraping/playwright-scraper-base.cjs`: Base scraper class with anti-detection capabilities
- `src/scraping/zillow-scraper.cjs`: Zillow-specific implementation

### 2. Enhanced Lead Scoring

We've implemented a sophisticated lead scoring system that evaluates properties on multiple dimensions:

- **Distress Signals**: Scores based on foreclosure status, tax liens, probate, etc.
- **Equity Position**: Calculates potential equity in properties
- **Contact Quality**: Evaluates availability and quality of contact information
- **Motivation Signals**: Assesses seller motivation through various signals
- **Location Analysis**: Factors in neighborhood characteristics

Key files:
- `src/scoring/leadScoring.cjs`: Core lead scoring implementation

### 3. Scraper Scheduling System

We've created a robust scheduling system for regular data collection:

- **Configurable Schedules**: Cron-based scheduling for different data sources
- **Geographic Targeting**: Configurable target areas for scraping
- **Distressed Property Focus**: Special handling for distressed property sources
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error capture and reporting
- **Logging**: Detailed activity logging for monitoring and debugging

Key files:
- `scraper-scheduler.cjs`: Scheduler implementation with cron integration
- `config/scraper-config.json`: Configuration file for scraper settings

## Implementation Benefits

1. **More Reliable Scraping**: Advanced anti-detection techniques ensure consistent data collection
2. **Higher Quality Leads**: Sophisticated scoring helps prioritize the best opportunities
3. **Automated Operation**: Scheduling system reduces manual intervention requirements
4. **Scalable Design**: Infrastructure supports adding new data sources easily
5. **Better Data Integration**: Enhanced fusion with ATTOM data provides comprehensive property profiles

## Using the New System

### Running the Zillow Scraper

```javascript
const ZillowScraper = require('./src/scraping/zillow-scraper.cjs');

async function runZillowScraper() {
  // Initialize the scraper
  const scraper = new ZillowScraper({
    headless: true,
    screenshots: true,
    screenshotDir: './screenshots/zillow'
  });
  
  await scraper.initialize();
  
  // Search for a property by address
  const properties = await scraper.searchByAddress('123 Main St, Los Angeles, CA');
  
  // Search for distressed properties in an area
  const distressedProperties = await scraper.searchDistressedProperties('Los Angeles, CA', 5);
  
  // Clean up resources
  await scraper.close();
  
  return [...properties, ...distressedProperties];
}
```

### Using the Scraping Pipeline

```javascript
const ScrapingPipeline = require('./src/scrapingPipeline.cjs');

async function processScrapeData(scrapedProperties) {
  // Initialize the pipeline
  const pipeline = new ScrapingPipeline({
    storagePath: './data'
  });
  
  // Process the scraped properties
  const results = await pipeline.processScrapedProperties({
    source: 'ZILLOW',
    items: scrapedProperties
  }, {
    enhanceWithAttom: true,
    deduplicate: true,
    scoreLeads: true
  });
  
  // Save results to file
  pipeline.saveResultsToFile(results, 'processed-properties.json');
  
  return results;
}
```

### Running the Scheduler

```bash
# Run the scheduler with default settings
node scraper-scheduler.cjs

# Run with immediate test mode
node scraper-scheduler.cjs --test "Los Angeles, CA"

# Run with distressed properties only
node scraper-scheduler.cjs --test "Los Angeles, CA" --distressed
```

## Next Steps

1. **Add More Scrapers**: Implement additional scraper classes for Redfin, Realtor.com, and other sources
2. **Database Integration**: Replace file-based storage with a proper database system
3. **API Development**: Create a REST API to access the property data
4. **Machine Learning Enhancement**: Train models to better identify distress signals
5. **User Interface**: Develop a front-end for reviewing and managing scraped data

## Maintenance Recommendations

1. **Regular Selector Updates**: Web interfaces change frequently - monitor and update selectors
2. **Proxy Rotation**: Maintain a healthy pool of proxies to avoid blocking
3. **Captcha Monitoring**: Track captcha frequency and adjust scraping patterns accordingly
4. **Performance Optimization**: Implement caching strategies for repeated operations
