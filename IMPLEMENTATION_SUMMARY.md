# FlipTracker Scraping System Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive property data scraping and enrichment system for FlipTracker with these key components:

1. **Data Fusion Engine**: Intelligently merges property data from multiple sources with source reliability ranking
2. **Enhanced Property Storage**: File-based JSON storage with deduplication and normalization
3. **Address Normalization**: Standardizes property addresses for reliable matching
4. **Lead Scoring System**: Advanced scoring algorithm for distressed property opportunities
5. **Playwright-Based Scrapers**: Modern web scrapers with anti-detection features
6. **Scheduling System**: Automated scraper execution with configurable targets

## Key Components Implemented

### Core Fusion System

The fusion system merges property data from multiple sources:
- Source reliability ranking prioritizes more trustworthy data sources
- Completeness scoring evaluates which source has the most complete information
- Field-level merging makes intelligent decisions about which data to keep
- Conflict tracking maintains an audit trail of data discrepancies

### Enhanced Storage with Fusion

The storage system extends basic file storage with:
- Deduplication based on normalized addresses
- Property fusion when new data arrives
- Indexing for efficient lookups
- Standardized property format

### Address Normalization

The normalization module:
- Standardizes addresses into a canonical format
- Creates consistent hashes for deduplication
- Handles malformed or incomplete addresses
- Provides parsing capabilities

### Advanced Lead Scoring

The lead scoring system evaluates properties on multiple dimensions:
- Distress signal detection (foreclosure, tax liens, etc.)
- Equity position assessment
- Contact information quality
- Seller motivation signals
- Geographic location factors

### Playwright-Based Scrapers

Our modern scraping system features:
- Anti-detection measures to prevent blocking
- Human-like behavior simulation
- Proxy rotation support
- Configurable scrapers for different data sources
- Standardized data output format

### Scraper Scheduling

The scheduling system provides:
- Cron-based execution of scraper tasks
- Geographic targeting for focused data collection
- Specialized workflows for distressed properties
- Comprehensive logging
- Error handling and reporting

## Test Results

We have successfully tested:

1. **Core Fusion**: Demonstrated merging of property data from multiple sources
2. **Storage Integration**: Verified deduplication and indexing functions
3. **Pipeline Processing**: End-to-end testing of normalization, fusion, and storage
4. **Zillow Scraper**: Verified with simulated data (Playwright integration ready)
5. **Lead Scoring**: Confirmed correct evaluation of property opportunities

## Benefits Delivered

1. **Higher Quality Data**: Multiple-source fusion improves completeness and accuracy
2. **Lead Prioritization**: Smart scoring focuses efforts on the best opportunities
3. **Automation**: Reduced manual work through scheduled scraping
4. **Standardization**: Consistent data format throughout the system
5. **Resilience**: Anti-detection measures ensure reliable data collection

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Production**: Set up the system in the production environment
2. **Add More Data Sources**: Implement additional scrapers (Redfin, Auction.com, etc.)
3. **Database Migration**: Move from file-based storage to a proper database
4. **UI Integration**: Connect the system with the FlipTracker user interface
5. **Machine Learning**: Train models to better identify distress signals

## Maintenance Instructions

1. **Update Selectors**: When websites change, update the corresponding scraper selectors
2. **Monitor Logs**: Regularly check logs for increased error rates or captchas
3. **Rotate Proxies**: Keep proxy lists fresh to avoid detection
4. **Update User Agents**: Periodically update the list of user agents
5. **Schedule Tuning**: Adjust scraping schedules to avoid peak times on target sites

## Installation

The system requires:
- Node.js 14+
- Optional: Playwright for web scraping
- Optional: node-postal for advanced address normalization

Installation:
```bash
npm install
# Optional for web scraping:
npm install playwright
npx playwright install chrome
```

## Usage

Run the pipeline test:
```bash
node scraping-pipeline-test.cjs
```

Run the Zillow scraper test (simulated mode):
```bash
node zillow-scraper-test.cjs
```

Run the scraper scheduler:
```bash
node scraper-scheduler.cjs [--test "Los Angeles, CA"] [--distressed]
```
