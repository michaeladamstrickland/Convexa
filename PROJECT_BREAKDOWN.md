## LeadFlow AI — Project Breakdown

### Task receipt & plan
I will summarize what exists in this repository, list key implemented features, point to important files and systems, and lay out planned next work and priorities. The goal is a single source-of-truth `PROJECT_BREAKDOWN.md` at the repo root for developers and stakeholders.

## Quick checklist (from user request)
- [x] Produce a full breakdown of what has been done so far.
- [x] Create a detailed `.md` file that outlines what we are set up for.
- [x] Document what was planned to work on next.

## High-level status

- Project: LeadFlow AI (real-estate lead generation + AI analysis)
- Branch: DataBaseFix (current workspace branch)
- Primary stacks: Node.js + TypeScript backend, Prisma ORM, React frontend (Vite) planned, SQLite/Postgres in different places, OpenAI integration, Puppeteer scrapers.

## What has been implemented (evidence & key files)

The repository already contains extensive documentation and working code. Key evidences of implemented systems:

- Consolidated top-level docs: `README.md`, `PHASE_1_ULTRA_INTELLIGENCE_COMPLETE.md`, `PHASE_4_DEVELOPER_ROADMAP.md`, `TODO.md` — provide roadmap, phase summaries and TODOs.
- Backend core:
  - `backend/package.json` with scripts for dev, migrations and seeds.
  - `backend/src/server.ts` (server mount points referenced in docs) and many `backend/src/*` folders (controllers, routes, services, scrapers, jobs).
  - `backend/README.md` (project-specific instructions and quick-start notes).
- Main app launcher and empire orchestration: `src/index.ts` and `src/empire/*` references (LeadFlowAILauncher, LeadFlowAIEmpire) — shows Phase 1 systems and Phase 2 launcher.
- Package manifest: `package.json` at repo root (name: leadflow-ai-empire) lists dependencies: `@prisma/client`, `axios`, `puppeteer`, `openai`, `winston`, `sqlite3`, etc.
- Prisma schema (root `prisma/schema.prisma`) defines core models: `Lead`, `ProbateCase`, `PropertyViolation`, `Campaign`, `Contact` (SQLite dev DB `dev.db`). This shows persistent lead and campaign modeling is present.
- Phase documentation: `PHASE_1_ULTRA_INTELLIGENCE_COMPLETE.md` documents multiple intelligence modules (obituary mining, probate tracking, vacancy detection, tax delinquency, code violation extractor) and claims they are deployed/operational.
- Roadmap and budgets: `PHASE_4_DEVELOPER_ROADMAP.md` outlines Phase 4 production plan including ATTOM, DataTree, OpenAI, Google Maps integration and a 15-day timeline with deliverables.

## Systems & Capabilities (concrete)

- Intelligence Modules (documented as implemented):
  - Obituary / death mining
  - Probate court tracking
  - Code violation extraction
  - Vacancy detection (vision + utilities)
  - Tax delinquency intelligence
  - Neural-network based motivation predictor

- Lead life-cycle & persistence:
  - Modelled in Prisma: leads, probate cases, property violations, campaigns, contacts
  - Core fields include contact info, motivation score, estimated value, equity, scores, statuses and timestamps.

- Scraping & enrichment:
  - Puppeteer-based scrapers (Zillow FSBO and likely others)
  - Cheerio/axios used for parsing and enrichment

- AI integration:
  - OpenAI used for scoring, heir mapping, strategy generation (documents and code reference GPT-4 integration)

- Orchestration & automation:
  - `LeadFlowAILauncher` and empire orchestration code present for batch operations, continuous runs, reporting and export

- API & routes (documented):
  - Endpoints like `/api/leads`, `/api/scraper/*`, `/api/auth/*`, `/api/master/*` and system routes for health/cost

## How to run (what's available now)

Notes below are inferred from existing scripts and `backend/package.json` / root `package.json`:

- Development backend (typical):
  - `cd backend` then `npm install` and `npm run dev` (script uses `tsx src/server.ts` in many manifests)
- Local DB: root `prisma/schema.prisma` uses SQLite `dev.db` for quick dev; backend may use PostgreSQL in production (docs reference Postgres in regions).
- DB commands in package.json: `prisma generate`, `migrate dev`, and seed scripts available.

## What's planned next (documented roadmap & TODOs)

The repo contains explicit plans and roadmaps; condensed next-work items below (short-term to medium):

Short-term / Phase 4 tasks (highest priority):
- Integration of paid, production APIs (Phase 4):
  - ATTOM Data API (property/master data)
  - DataTree (probate records)
  - OpenAI (production prompts and cost controls)
  - Google Maps / Street View (address validation, vision analysis)
- Frontend development and integration:
  - Build React dashboard (`frontend/`) and components: `LeadflowGenerator`, `MasterLeadGeneration`, dashboards, exports
  - Wire up auth and role-based access
- Database and infra hardening:
  - Finalize which DB in production (Postgres recommended), migrate from SQLite if needed
  - Apply Prisma migrations and seed data
- Observability and error tracking:
  - Add Sentry, structured logging, alerts, and metrics

Medium-term / Phase 2/3 items:
- Skip-tracing provider integrations and cost fallback logic
- Campaign engine: multi-channel (SMS, email, direct mail, calls) and DNC/TCPA compliance
- Rate limiters, API cost monitoring and chargeback
- Tests: unit tests, integration tests and CI pipeline

Long-term / scaling:
- Multi-tenant/organization support and permission boundaries
- Performance scaling for 100k+ leads/month
- Billing, team collaboration and export analytics

## Known gaps & uncertainties (action items)

- Environment variables: many features require API keys (OpenAI, ATTOM, DataTree, Google). They are referenced but not present in repo — ensure `.env` is configured.
- DB provider mismatch: root Prisma uses SQLite (`dev.db`) while docs mention PostgreSQL; decide one production DB and consolidate schemas.
- Frontend status: `frontend/` exists but may be partial — ensure `frontend/package.json` and `src/` components are completed and routed.
- Tests & CI: tests exist partially; lack of full coverage and CI config in visible files. Add unit/integration suites and GitHub Actions or similar.
- Security/compliance: PII handling, DNC/TCPA, contract/process for skip trace providers need formalization.

## Suggested immediate next steps (concrete starter tasks)

1. Pick production DB and align Prisma schemas (Postgres recommended). Run: `npx prisma migrate dev` after updating `DATABASE_URL`.
2. Add missing production API keys to secure vault and `.env` (ATTOM, DataTree, OPENAI_API_KEY, GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY, TWILIO creds where needed).
3. Wire the frontend to `/api/master/ultimate-search` route to verify end-to-end pipeline with demo data.
4. Create a minimal CI: run `npm test` and `npm run lint` on push; add quick GitHub Actions workflow.
5. Add observability: Sentry DSN and basic dashboards for errors and API cost spikes.

## Priority list (first 30 days)

1. Attach real API keys and test a full `ultimate-search` end-to-end flow (ATTOM + DataTree + OpenAI) — validate data quality and cost.
2. Consolidate DB to Postgres and run Prisma migrations.
3. Complete frontend lead generation UI, authentication, and CSV export.
4. Add automated tests for core services (lead scoring, scraping, API orchestration).
5. Basic production deployment (DigitalOcean / Render / Railway), enable HTTPS, backups and monitoring.

## Files to review first (for new dev)

- `README.md` (root) — high-level instructions
- `backend/README.md` — backend quick start
- `prisma/schema.prisma` (root) — data model in dev
- `backend/src` routes & services — to map endpoints and orchestration
- `src/index.ts` — empire launcher and CLI examples
- `PHASE_4_DEVELOPER_ROADMAP.md` & `PHASE_1_ULTRA_INTELLIGENCE_COMPLETE.md` — the product roadmap and implemented features

## Contact & handoff notes

When handing off to an engineer to continue work, provide:
- A `.env` with test keys (never commit real secrets to repo).
- Which DB to use in staging (connection string) and access credentials.
- A short runbook for starting servers (backend, frontend) and expected ports.

## Final notes

This project is far along: the repository contains production-grade architecture, a detailed phase roadmap, multiple intelligence modules, and a functioning persistence model. The most valuable near-term work is finishing production API integrations, stabilizing DB choices, and shipping the frontend integration + observability. After that, add tests, CI, and scaling work.
