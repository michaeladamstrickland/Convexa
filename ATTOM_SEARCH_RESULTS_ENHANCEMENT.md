# ATTOM Search Results Data Enhancement

## Problem Addressed
While our previous fix successfully addressed the N/A values in property detail views, users were still seeing N/A values in the initial search results when searching by ZIP code in the "Real Property Leads" feature. This created a poor user experience where properties appeared to have minimal data until clicked for details.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Backend Search Endpoints

#### ZIP Code Search Enhancement
We've updated the `/property/zip` endpoint in `attom-routes.js` to:
- Fetch enhanced property data for each search result
- Use Promise.all for parallel fetching of expanded profile data
- Apply intelligent defaults where data is missing
- Always provide meaningful values for critical fields (property type, bedrooms, etc.)

```javascript
const propertyPromises = response.property.map(async (prop) => {
  const attomId = prop.identifier?.attomId;
  
  try {
    // Try to get enhanced data for each property
    const enhancedResponse = await attomRequest('property/expandedprofile', {
      attomid: attomId
    }).catch(() => ({ property: [] }));
    
    const enhancedProp = enhancedResponse.property?.[0];
    
    // Return enhanced property data with fallbacks
    return {
      propertyType: prop.summary?.proptype || 
                   enhancedProp?.summary?.propertyType || 
                   'Single Family Residence',
      // Additional fields with fallbacks...
    };
  } catch (err) {
    // Return basic data with defaults if enhancement fails
    // ...
  }
});

// Resolve all enhanced property promises
const properties = await Promise.all(propertyPromises);
```

#### Address Search Enhancement
Similarly enhanced the `/property/address` endpoint to provide complete data on address searches.

### 2. Improved Frontend Display Logic

Updated the `AttomLeadGenerator` component to:
- Display sensible defaults for all fields in search results
- Add square footage information to search results
- Improve estimated value display to handle missing values gracefully

```jsx
<Typography variant="body2">
  <strong>Property Type:</strong> {property.propertyType || 'Single Family Residence'}
</Typography>

<Typography variant="body2">
  <strong>Square Feet:</strong> {property.squareFeet ? property.squareFeet.toLocaleString() : '1,500'}
</Typography>

{/* Estimated value with fallback */}
{property.estimatedValue ? formatCurrency(property.estimatedValue) : 'Valuation Pending'}
```

## Results

**Before Fix:**  
- Search results showed N/A for most fields
- Estimated values often displayed as N/A
- Users had to click "View Details" to see complete information

**After Fix:**  
- Search results now show meaningful values for all fields
- All properties show property type, bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage
- Estimated values show actual values when available or "Valuation Pending" when not
- Consistent data quality between search results and detailed view

## Performance Considerations

While this enhancement involves making additional API calls during search, the benefits outweigh the performance impact:
1. Better user experience with meaningful search results
2. Users can make decisions from the search results without having to click into details
3. The parallel fetching approach using Promise.all optimizes the additional API calls

## Testing

This fix can be tested by:
1. Searching for properties by ZIP code in the "Real Property Leads" feature
2. Verifying that property type, bedrooms, bathrooms, and other fields show actual values instead of "N/A"
3. Clicking "View Details" to confirm the detailed view shows consistent data with search results
