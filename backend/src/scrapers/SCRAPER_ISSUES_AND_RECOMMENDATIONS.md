# Scraper Issues and Recommendations

## Current Status

As of September 10, 2025, both the Zillow and Auction.com scrapers are encountering anti-bot detection measures that are preventing successful data collection.

### Zillow Scraper Issues:
- Timeout errors when waiting for selector `[data-test="property-card"]`
- Website structure may have changed or anti-scraping measures enhanced

### Auction.com Scraper Issues:
- Timeout errors when waiting for selector `.property-details`
- URL structure has changed (now uses `/residential/search?search=` instead of `/search/?search=`)
- Detection of our automated browsing despite using puppeteer-extra with stealth plugins

## Technical Analysis

1. **Anti-Bot Detection**: Both sites appear to be using sophisticated anti-bot detection that can identify:
   - Puppeteer browser automation
   - Headless browsers
   - Automated navigation patterns

2. **Website Structure Changes**: The HTML structure may have changed, making our selectors outdated.

3. **IP Blocking**: It's possible that repeated requests from the same IP address are being flagged and blocked.

## Recommended Solutions

### Short-term Fixes:

1. **Use Non-Headless Mode for Testing**:
   ```javascript
   // Set environment variable to run in visible browser mode
   process.env.PUPPETEER_HEADLESS = 'false';
   ```

2. **Implement Request Rotation**:
   - Add delays between 5-15 seconds between page navigation
   - Implement exponential backoff for retries

3. **Use Proxy Services**:
   - Implement IP rotation using a proxy service
   - Example proxy integration:
   ```javascript
   const browser = await puppeteerExtra.launch({
     args: [
       '--proxy-server=http://proxy-address:port',
       // other args...
     ]
   });
   ```

### Medium-term Solutions:

1. **API Integration**: Research if Zillow or Auction.com offer official APIs that can be used instead of scraping:
   - Zillow offers a Partner API: https://www.zillow.com/developers/
   - Auction.com might have affiliate data access programs

2. **User Session Emulation**:
   - Store and reuse cookies from a manual browsing session
   - Implement humanlike mouse movements and scrolling
   ```javascript
   // Example of human-like scroll implementation
   async function humanLikeScroll(page) {
     const height = await page.evaluate(() => document.body.scrollHeight);
     const viewportHeight = await page.evaluate(() => window.innerHeight);
     
     for (let i = 0; i < height; i += Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 50) {
       await page.evaluate(scrollY => window.scrollTo(0, scrollY), i);
       await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, Math.floor(Math.random() * 300) + 100));
     }
   }
   ```

3. **CAPTCHA Handling**:
   - Implement CAPTCHA solving services
   - Add manual intervention option for CAPTCHAs

### Long-term Solutions:

1. **Alternative Data Sources**:
   - County Records APIs
   - MLS data via partner relationships
   - Real estate data providers like ATTOM Data (already being integrated elsewhere in the project)

2. **Build Custom Browser Fingerprint Evasion**:
   - Canvas fingerprint randomization
   - WebRTC/WebGL fingerprint protection
   - Custom user-agent rotation based on real browser statistics

3. **Distributed Scraping Infrastructure**:
   - Run scrapers from multiple geographic locations
   - Implement queue systems to manage and distribute scraping tasks
   - Use serverless functions for better IP rotation

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Modify the scrapers to run in non-headless mode for debugging
2. Review the screenshots and HTML content collected to identify new selectors
3. Implement basic proxy rotation
4. Run targeted tests with increased timeouts and more flexible selector matching
5. Explore the Zillow API as an alternative data source
6. If scraping is still required, consider using commercial-grade scraping libraries that specialize in evading detection

## Conclusion

The current scraper implementation needs significant updates to handle the enhanced anti-bot measures on both Zillow and Auction.com. We recommend a two-pronged approach:

1. Attempt the short-term fixes for immediate results
2. Begin exploring the medium and long-term solutions for sustainable data collection

Remember that website terms of service may prohibit scraping. Always ensure compliance with legal requirements and consider official API access where available.
