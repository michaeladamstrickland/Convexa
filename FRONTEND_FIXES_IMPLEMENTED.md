# Frontend Error Resolution: Implementation Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **MUI Grid Deprecation Warnings**
   - Removed deprecated `item` props from Grid components
   - Updated multiple files including `AttomLeadGenerator.jsx`, `AttomPropertyLookup.jsx`, etc.

2. **React Router Warning**
   - Added `future={{ v7_relativeSplatPath: true }}` to BrowserRouter in `main.tsx`

3. **API 404 Error**
   - Changed API endpoint in frontend from `/api/zip-search-new/add-lead` to `/api/leads/add-lead`
   - Added new endpoint handler in `leads.ts` for processing lead creation

## Implementation Details

### MUI Grid Migration

- Created and ran PowerShell script `fix-mui-grid.ps1`
- Script automatically found and updated Grid components in frontend files
- Removed deprecated `item` prop while preserving breakpoint props

### React Router Configuration

- Updated `BrowserRouter` in `main.tsx` to use recommended future flags
- This ensures compatibility with upcoming React Router v7

### API Integration

- Added new endpoint in `leads.ts` for handling lead creation:
  ```typescript
  router.post('/add-lead', (req, res, next) => {
    // Set source to identify where the lead came from
    req.body.source = 'manual-attom';
    
    // Use the existing controller
    createLead(req, res, next);
  });
  ```
- Updated frontend code to use the correct endpoint:
  ```javascript
  const LEADS_API_URL = 'http://localhost:5001/api/leads';
  ```

## Manual Changes Required

For a complete solution:

1. **MUI Grid v2 Migration**
   - While we removed the `item` prop, there might be other Grid properties that need updates
   - Refer to [MUI Grid v2 Migration Guide](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/upgrade-to-grid-v2/)

2. **Aria-hidden Accessibility Warning**
   - This requires updating modal dialog implementations to manage focus properly
   - Ensure dialogs trap focus and handle keyboard navigation according to accessibility guidelines

## Verification

To verify the fixes are working:

1. Run the application and check the browser console for errors
2. Test the lead creation functionality using the AttomLeadGenerator
3. Verify that Grid components render correctly in the UI

The application should now run without the previous console errors.
