  - **IMMEDIATE FOCUS**: Deal Analysis Engine completion
  - Secondary: Batch processing framework improvements
  
- **Frontend Development**: 35%
  - **IMMEDIATE FOCUS**: Property Search filters and detail view
  - Secondary: Basic dashboard elements
  
- **QA & Testing**: 5%
  - Focus exclusively on testing Deal Analysis Engine and Property Search
  
- **DevOps & Documentation**: 0%
  - Pause all DevOps and documentation work until critical MVP features are complete
  
> **Note:** This resource allocation reflects the immediate critical priorities. Once the Deal Analysis Engine and Property Search features are complete, we will rebalance resources to address other MVP requirements.

## Conclusion

The FlipTracker project has made significant progress on core infrastructure and API integrations, but the immediate focus must be exclusively on completing the Deal Analysis Engine and Property Search functionality, which are critical for MVP viability.

All other development work should be paused until these core features are complete. By maintaining this laser focus on these MVP-critical features, we can ensure that the core value proposition of FlipTracker is delivered to users.
