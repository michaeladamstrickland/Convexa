## Additional Tasks

- [ ] Connect to actual backend API endpoints
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for edge cases
- [ ] Write unit tests for components
- [ ] Write integration tests for user flows
- [ ] Perform accessibility audit and improvements
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for power users
- [ ] Add comprehensive analytics tracking
- [ ] Create admin reporting tools for skip trace usage

## Known Issues

- The implementation currently uses mock data and needs to be connected to real API endpoints
- Type definitions may need refinement based on actual API responses
- Cost tracking needs to be aligned with actual provider billing models

## Next Steps

1. Coordinate with backend team to ensure API endpoints match the expected interface
2. Implement proper error handling for API failures
3. Add loading states for better user experience
4. Conduct user testing to validate UX flows
5. Create automated tests to ensure component reliability
