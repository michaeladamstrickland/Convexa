# Enhanced Scraping Implementation Plan

## 1. Current Implementation (Completed)

✅ **Standardized Output Format**
- Created TypeScript interfaces for scraped properties
- Defined standard output contract with consistent fields

✅ **Address and Owner Name Normalization**
- Implemented basic normalization with robust handling of variants
- Address hashing for deduplication

✅ **Lead Scoring System**
- Scoring based on distress signals and other factors
- Temperature categorization system (Dead, Warm, Hot, On Fire)

## 2. Next Immediate Steps

### Step 1: Full Input/Output Contract Standardization
- Update existing scrapers to output in the new format
- Test with a small sample of scrapers
- Create adapter for legacy scrapers

### Step 2: Integrate libpostal for Address Normalization
- Install and set up libpostal bindings
- Update normalize.js with proper libpostal integration
- Add tests for complex addresses

### Step 3: Add Simple Data Storage
- Create a simple JSON storage system for scraped properties
- Implement addressHash-based deduplication
- Enable lookup by address or hash

## 3. Medium-term Steps

### Step 4: Playwright Integration
- Set up Playwright with anti-bot protections
- Create a PlaywrightScraperBase class
- Port one scraper as proof-of-concept
- Add stealth feature flags

### Step 5: Fusion Logic and Enrichment
- Implement property record merging with source weighting
- Connect to ATTOM API for enrichment
- Add conflict detection and resolution

### Step 6: API Integration
- Create a /scrape/intake endpoint
- Add batch processing capability
- Implement scheduling and priority queues

## 4. Advanced Features (Final Phase)

### Step 7: Lead Routing and UI Integration
- Connect scoring system to Kanban board
- Add UI filters for distress signals and temperature
- Create dashboards for monitoring scraper health

### Step 8: Full Observability
- Add detailed metrics for scraper performance
- Save failure screenshots and HTML
- Implement cost tracking and optimization

## Implementation Notes

1. We're taking an incremental approach to avoid breaking existing functionality.
2. Each step should be fully tested before moving to the next.
3. Backward compatibility is maintained throughout the process.
4. Feature flags will allow selective enablement of new capabilities.
