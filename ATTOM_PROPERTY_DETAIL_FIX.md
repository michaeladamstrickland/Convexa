# ATTOM Property Detail Fix

## Issue Summary
Users reported that when searching for properties using the "Real Property Leads" feature and selecting "View Details," most property fields showed "N/A" instead of actual data.

## Root Cause
The issue was occurring because of inconsistencies in the data flow between components:

1. The `AttomLeadGenerator` component (Real Property Leads) was using the `/property/{attomId}` endpoint, which returns a simplified property data structure
2. The `PropertyDetailEnhanced` component expects a more comprehensive data structure from the `/property/{attomId}/detail` endpoint
3. This caused a mismatch where many fields were undefined, resulting in "N/A" values throughout the UI

## Solution Implemented

We modified the `handleSelectProperty` function in both the `AttomLeadGenerator` and `AttomPropertySearch` components to use the comprehensive `/property/{attomId}/detail` endpoint instead of the basic endpoint. This ensures all required fields are available when viewing property details.

### Changes Made

1. Updated `handleSelectProperty` in `AttomLeadGenerator.jsx` to use the comprehensive property detail endpoint
2. Updated `handleSelectProperty` in `AttomPropertySearch.jsx` to use the same comprehensive endpoint
3. Added fallback logic to handle cases where the comprehensive endpoint might fail
4. Created a test script (`test-attom-detail.js`) to verify data flow between different endpoints

### Key Improvements

The comprehensive `/property/{attomId}/detail` endpoint provides several advantages:
- Combines data from multiple ATTOM API calls
- Handles field name variations and case sensitivity issues
- Includes debugging information for easier troubleshooting
- Has complete valuation data built-in

## Testing

You can test the fix by:
1. Searching for properties by ZIP code in the "Real Property Leads" feature
2. Clicking "View Details" on any property
3. Verifying that fields like Property Type, Year Built, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, etc. now show actual values instead of "N/A"

## Technical Details

The comprehensive endpoint in `attom-routes.js` uses the `logValue` helper function which:
1. Handles field name variations (e.g., `proptype` vs `propertyType`)
2. Checks multiple data sources for each field
3. Provides detailed logging for debugging
4. Applies appropriate data type conversions

## Future Improvements

For even more robust property data handling:
1. Consider implementing a centralized property data service
2. Add data validation to catch missing or incorrect fields early
3. Implement a caching layer to improve performance and reduce API calls
4. Consider adding a property data normalization step to standardize field names
