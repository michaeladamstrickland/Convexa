# Skip Trace UI Deployment Guide

This guide outlines the process for deploying the skip trace UI components to production.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

1. Backend API endpoints fully implemented and tested
2. Necessary environment variables configured
3. Access to the production deployment pipeline
4. QA sign-off on all skip trace UI components

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] All components render correctly in dev environment
- [ ] All API endpoints return expected data
- [ ] Error handling works for all edge cases
- [ ] Types are aligned with actual API responses
- [ ] Performance meets expectations with large datasets
- [ ] Accessibility standards are met

### 2. Update Environment Configuration

Ensure the following environment variables are set in your production environment:

```
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=/api
REACT_APP_SKIP_TRACE_COST_TRACKING=enabled
REACT_APP_SKIP_TRACE_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=exactdata
REACT_APP_SKIP_TRACE_COMPLIANCE_CHECK=enabled
```

### 3. Build Process

Run the production build process:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Build for production
npm run build

# Verify build output
ls -la build/
```

### 4. Integration Testing

Before finalizing deployment:

1. Test all skip trace components with production API endpoints
2. Verify cost tracking works correctly
3. Ensure compliance flags display properly
4. Test bulk operations with large datasets

### 5. Deployment

Deploy using your standard deployment pipeline:

```bash
# Example deployment command (adjust to your deployment process)
npm run deploy
```

### 6. Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Skip trace button appears on lead cards
- [ ] Skip trace modal opens correctly
- [ ] Bulk skip trace works with multiple leads
- [ ] Dashboard widget displays correct metrics
- [ ] Lead contacts panel displays skip trace results
- [ ] Cost tracking is accurate and properly displayed

### 7. Rollback Plan

If issues are encountered:

1. Identify the specific component causing problems
2. Roll back to previous version if necessary
3. Fix issues in development environment
4. Re-deploy after thorough testing

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:

- API response times for skip trace operations
- Error rates for skip trace requests
- User engagement with skip trace features
- Cost metrics for skip trace operations

## User Communication

Prepare the following communications:

1. Release notes highlighting new skip trace features
2. Brief tutorial on using skip trace features
3. FAQ for common questions about skip trace functionality
4. Support contact for any issues encountered

## Support Plan

Establish a support plan:

1. Designate primary contact for skip trace feature support
2. Create troubleshooting guide for common issues
3. Establish escalation path for complex problems
4. Schedule follow-up review 1 week after deployment
