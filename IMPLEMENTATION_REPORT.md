# MVP Data Layer Stabilization & Unified Search - Implementation Report

## Summary of Requirements

This task required stabilizing the MVP data layer by standardizing on Prisma as the canonical data source while preserving the better-sqlite3 implementation in an experimental namespace. Additionally, we needed to extend the Lead model with several fields, implement a unified search API with caching, and update the frontend to use the new endpoints.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Prisma as Canonical Data Source

We have successfully established Prisma as the primary data source for the application. The Prisma schema has been updated with all required fields for the Lead model, and migrations have been run to update the database schema.

```typescript
// Example search service using Prisma
async searchLeads(params: SearchParams) {
  // Build query filters with Prisma
  const where: Prisma.LeadWhereInput = {};
  
  // Using Prisma client for database operations
  const leads = await prisma.lead.findMany({
    where,
    take: limit,
    skip,
    orderBy,
  });
  
  return {
    leads: formattedLeads,
    pagination
  };
}
```

### 2. better-sqlite3 in Experimental Namespace

The existing better-sqlite3 implementation has been moved to an experimental API namespace under `/api/_experimental/` routes:

```typescript
// Example experimental route using better-sqlite3
router.get('/search', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  try {
    // ...
    let sql = 'SELECT * FROM Lead';
    const params: any[] = [];
    const whereClauses: string[] = [];
    
    // ... build query with better-sqlite3
    
    // Execute query
    const leads = db.prepare(sql).all(...params);
    
    res.json({
      leads: formattedLeads,
      pagination: {
        total: totalCount,
        page: parseInt(page as string),
        limit: parseInt(limit as string),
        pages: Math.ceil(totalCount / parseInt(limit as string))
      }
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error in experimental search endpoint:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
  }
});
```

### 3. Extended Lead Model

We extended the Lead model with the following fields:

- `temperature_tag`: Indicates the lead's temperature (ON_FIRE, HOT, WARM, COLD, DEAD)
- `status`: Tracks the lead's status (NEW, CONTACTED, NEGOTIATING, UNDER_CONTRACT, CLOSED, DEAD)
- `phones`: Array of phone numbers (stored as a JSON string for SQLite compatibility)
- `emails`: Array of email addresses (stored as a JSON string for SQLite compatibility)
- `source`: Source category (probate, violation, tax_lien, foreclosure, divorce)
- `raw_data`: Raw source data (stored as a JSON string for SQLite compatibility)
- `aiScore`: AI-calculated score

Due to SQLite limitations with enums, arrays, and JSON fields, we implemented these as string fields with appropriate parsing in the application layer.

### 4. Unified Search API with Caching

We implemented a robust search API with the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/search` - Search with query parameters
- `POST /api/search` - Search with request body
- `GET /api/search/analytics` - Get lead analytics
- `POST /api/search/clear-cache` - Clear search cache

The search functionality includes filtering by:
- Text query (address or owner name)
- Value range (min/max property value)
- Location (city, state, ZIP)
- Property type and source
- Temperature and status

We implemented caching using node-cache with a 5-minute TTL to improve performance.

```typescript
// Caching implementation
const cache = new NodeCache({ stdTTL: 300 });

// In search method
const cacheKey = JSON.stringify(params);
const cachedResults = cache.get(cacheKey);
if (cachedResults) {
  return cachedResults;
}

// ... perform search

// Cache results
cache.set(cacheKey, results);
```

### 5. Frontend Implementation

We created a comprehensive frontend implementation with:

- SearchService for API communication
- LeadSearch component with filtering, pagination, and analytics
- Integration with the application's routing and layout

```typescript
// Frontend search service
const searchService = {
  searchLeads: async (params: SearchParams): Promise<SearchResponse> => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.post(`${API_URL}/api/search`, params);
      return response.data;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error searching leads:', error);
      throw error;
    }
  },
  // ... other methods
};
```

## Acceptance Criteria Status

✅ **AC1: Prisma is the canonical data source**
- Implemented Prisma schema extensions
- Created search service using Prisma client
- All data operations now use Prisma by default

✅ **AC2: better-sqlite3 code preserved in experimental namespace**
- Moved implementation to `/api/_experimental/` routes
- Original functionality preserved
- Database connection handled safely

✅ **AC3: Lead model extended with required fields**
- Added all required fields: temperature_tag, status, phones, emails, source, raw_data, aiScore
- Adapted schema for SQLite compatibility
- Updated seed script with diverse sample data

✅ **AC4: Unified search API with caching implemented**
- Created endpoints for searching, analytics, and cache management
- Implemented filtering, pagination, and sorting
- Added caching with 5-minute TTL for performance

✅ **AC5: Frontend updated to use new endpoints**
- Created SearchService for API communication
- Implemented LeadSearch component with filtering and analytics
- Added search page route and navigation
- Integrated with existing application layout

## Technical Challenges Overcome

1. **SQLite Limitations**: Adapted the schema to work around SQLite's lack of support for enums, arrays, and JSON fields.
2. **API Consistency**: Ensured the new Prisma-based API maintains the same response structure as the original better-sqlite3 implementation.
3. **Caching Strategy**: Implemented efficient caching for search results while allowing for cache invalidation.
4. **Frontend Integration**: Seamlessly integrated new search functionality with existing frontend architecture.

## Next Steps

1. Consider migrating to PostgreSQL for native enum, array, and JSON support.
2. Implement advanced search features like fuzzy matching and geospatial search.
3. Add role-based access control for API endpoints.
4. Enhance analytics with visualization components.
5. Implement real-time updates with WebSockets for search results.

The implementation has successfully stabilized the MVP data layer while adding robust search capabilities with performance optimization through caching. All acceptance criteria have been met, and the system is ready for the next phase of development.
