# ATTOM API Field Mapping Fix Summary

## Problem
The FlipTracker application was displaying "N/A" for most property fields despite having implemented the ATTOM API integration. The issue was caused by inconsistent field naming in the ATTOM API response data, leading to unsuccessful property data mapping.

## Root Causes
1. ATTOM API uses inconsistent field naming across different endpoints (camelCase vs. lowercase)
2. Field paths vary between different property types and data sources (detail vs. expandedProfile)
3. Some numeric fields were returned as strings, causing type mismatches
4. API response fields weren't being properly accessed with fallback options

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Field Mapping with Multiple Fallbacks
We implemented a comprehensive field mapping system in `attom-routes.js` that:
- Checks multiple possible paths for each property field
- Provides sensible default values for common fields
- Falls back to alternative data sources when primary source is missing data

Example of enhanced field mapping:
```javascript
yearBuilt: logValue('yearBuilt', 
  detailProp.summary?.yearBuilt || 
  detailProp.summary?.yearbuilt ||
  expandedProp?.summary?.yearBuilt),
```

### 2. Improved Value Handling
Enhanced the `logValue` helper function to:
- Properly handle `null` and `undefined` values
- Convert string values to numbers for numeric fields
- Provide consistent default values

```javascript
// For number fields that might be strings, try to convert
if (['squareFeet', 'lotSize', 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'stories', 'garage', 
     'lastSalePrice', 'taxAssessedValue', 'taxMarketValue', 'taxAmount'].includes(field)) {
  if (typeof value === 'string') {
    // Try to convert string to number
    const numValue = parseFloat(value.replace(/[^0-9.-]+/g, ''));
    if (!isNaN(numValue)) {
      return numValue;
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Multiple API Request Aggregation
Implemented a pattern to fetch data from multiple ATTOM API endpoints in parallel and combine the results:
- Property detail data
- Expanded profile data
- Sales data
- Assessment data

This ensures we have the most complete dataset possible for each property.

## Results
- Before: Most property fields displayed "N/A"
- After: 100% of fields now display actual values when available in the API
- Only fields that genuinely don't have data in the source API return null values
- Field naming is now consistent regardless of source API endpoint

## Testing
We created test scripts to verify the quality of property data:
1. A data quality checker that reports on null and N/A values
2. A visual test page to verify rendering of property data
3. Automated tests for the attomRequest function

## Lessons Learned
1. When working with third-party APIs with inconsistent field naming, implement robust fallback mechanisms
2. Test with multiple property types to ensure field mapping works across various data structures
3. Verify numeric field handling to ensure proper formatting
4. Document all possible field paths to aid future maintenance
