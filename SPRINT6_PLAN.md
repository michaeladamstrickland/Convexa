# Sprint 5.6 â€“ Observability + CRM Readiness

Status: Closed (All 6.1 tasks completed)

Delivered in this sprint:
- Properties Feed: Added filters (condition, minScore, tag, reason, tagReasons)
- Tests: Coverage for tag, reason, tagReasons filters
- Typecheck: Backend-only tsconfig.server.json with CI-safe script
- CI/Observability: Enforced --detectOpenHandles in test script
- Docs: Added PROPERTIES_FEED.md; linked from README; ENDPOINTS.md remains source of truth for wider API
- Metrics: Exposed feed usage counters in /api/dev/metrics

Follow-ups (carry to Sprint 6.1/7):
- Optional: Deep JSON matching for tagReasons (beyond tag proxy)
- Optional: Global teardown to eliminate residual stdout/stderr open-handle warnings
