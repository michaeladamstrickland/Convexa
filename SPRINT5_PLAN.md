# Sprint 5.5 — Enrichment Persistence & CRM Push Integration

Status: Complete ✅

Deliverables
- Persist enrichment explainability: `ScrapedProperty.reasons` (String[]) and `tagReasons` (Json) ✅
- Enrichment worker persists `reasons` and `tagReasons` alongside `investmentScore`, `enrichmentTags`, `condition` ✅
- Emit `matchmaking.completed` event after matchmaking job completion; deliver via existing webhook infrastructure ✅
- Add metrics:
  - `leadflow_webhook_deliveries_total{status, eventType}` ✅
  - `leadflow_webhook_delivery_total{event="matchmaking.completed"}` ✅
  - `leadflow_enrichment_reasons_count{reason="..."}` (optional distribution) ✅
- Tests:
  - Update enrichment.test to assert persisted `reasons`/`tagReasons` ✅
  - Add webhook-crm.test to validate headers, signature, payload, and metric increment for `matchmaking.completed` ✅
- Migrations and Prisma client regenerated ✅

Notes
- Webhooks doc updated with `matchmaking.completed`: payload, headers, delivery behavior.
- Dev metrics extended with enrichment reasons distribution via UNNEST over Postgres.
- Jest suites pass; open handles limited to stdout/stderr only.
